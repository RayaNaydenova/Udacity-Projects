            <p class="description"> The largest of the falcon species. The gyrfalcon is larger, broader-winged and longer-tailed than the peregrine falcon, which it is known to hunt. It differs from the buzzard in general structure, having pointed wings. The gyrfalcon is a very
                polymorphic species, so its plumage varies greatly. The archetypal morphs are called "white", "silver", "brown", and "black", though they can be coloured on a spectrum from all-white to very dark.White form gyrfalcons are the only predominantly
                white falcons. Silver gyrfalcons resemble a light grey lanner falcon of larger size. The species shows no sex-based colour differences; juveniles are darker and browner than adults.
